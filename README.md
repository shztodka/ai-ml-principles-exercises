# AI/ML principles exercises
This repository serves as a collection of exercises for the different courses from [FixedIT Consulting](https://fixedit.ai) relating to AI and ML in organizations. The exercises spans from simple getting started with ML exercises to advanced best practices using modern AI/ML and MLOps tools.

The repository is in a build-up phase and will see more exercises added over time.

An overview of the current exercises are:

## Introductional exercises
- `ML-training/intro-to-libraries` [EASY]: Introduction to different python libraries common in Machine Learning
- `ML-training/cv-crash-course` [EASY]: Crash course in Computer Vision and ML with `Python` and `sklearn`
- `ML-inference/intro-to-flask` [EASY]: A simple example how to make a web based REST endpoint for a model

## MLOps and best practices
- `ML-training/logging-trainings-with-WandB` [INTERMEDIATE]: Getting started with experiment tracking in `Weights and Biases`
- `ML-training/creating-reports-with-WandB` [INTERMEDIATE]: Writing interactive experiment reports with `Weights and Biases`
- `ML-training/activeloop-deeplake` [INTERMEDIATE]: Getting started with `ActiveLoop` for data exploration and visualization

## AutoML and APIs
